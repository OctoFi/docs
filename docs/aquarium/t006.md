# Transparency Report 006

We want to keep going with our aquarium transparency reports in an effort to provide full transparency for the actions of OctoFi. 

Since the token deployment, we are providing the following comprehensive details on token holdings and use of tokens to date. We also provide transparency reports on a monthly basis.

## Summary

The first ever OctoFi fee distribution to OCTO holders. 

Not your regular token airdrop of questionable value, or the catalyst for a sudden sell off. But rather the capture of real value distributed to the holders making OctoFi possible.

Although, this was an equal distribution to all holders, as opposed to weighted share based on amount of OCTO held.

- Earned Fees and Spend: **23,904 USDC**
- Each Holder: **8 USDC**
- Holders (as of 8:08:08 UTC snapshot): **2,988** 

Fee Distribution Wallet: [0x73F2...ce85](https://etherscan.io/address/0x73F29805198cCE93015bC960F47885CF6268ce85)

*Our 2.0 release we will have more than one.*
