# Interest Program
{: .d-inline-block }

{: .label .label-red }

A total of 200,000 OCTO split equally between interest yielding contract and airdrop, are allocated to the interest program.

An additional bonus yield is rewarded to supporters who take part in the first batch, scaled accordingly to their nominated runtime. Depending on the demand shown for the interest program, further bonus schemes may be opened, pending the relevant discussions required to revise the conditions. 

## Interest program details

We've chosen to keep the program as simple as possible. 

| Runtime    		    | Interest rate p.a.| Batch 001 bonus p.a.| Total accrual |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 3 months     			| 10% 			    | 2.5%                | 12.5% p.a.    |
| 6 months 	  	 	    | 15% 		  	    | 5%            	  | 20% p.a.   	  |
| 12 months    			| 22% 				| 10%              	  | 32% p.a.  	  |

As detailed in the above table, the yield for respective interest program runtimes are as follows:

* Three (3) months: 10% per annum
* Six (6) months: 15% per annum
* Twelve (12) months: 22% per annum

For investors participating in the first batch of the interest program, bonus yield as follows:

* Three (3) months: bonus 2.5% per annum
* Six (6) months: bonus 5% per annum
* Twelve (12) months: bonus 10% per annum

To better incentivize mid to long term runtimes, the 200,000 OCTO allocation is split equally between the standard interest program, and airdrops disbursed to addresses completing at least six (6) months of runtime.

* 100,000 for interest program yield payments
* 100,000 for interest program airdrop payments

Airdrops are specified as 100 OCTO to each address that successfully deposits a total of 100 OCTO[^1] and completes six (6) months runtime of the interest program ‚Äî obviously limited to the first 1,000 holders to do so.

## Interest program future

Additional yield bearing integrations shall be made pending community decisions made. The [earn.octo.fi](https://earn.octo.fi) interface is intended to be used to provide maximum value to Octonauts.

*Footnotes*

[^1]: *Deposits less than 100 OCTO are still eligible, provided that additional deposits from same address total 100 OCTO. If less than 1000 addresses lock 100 OCTO for 6 months, and a portion of the 100k allocation remains, deposits of lesser amounts will be considered for airdrops of the remainder. This would be decided by way of community governance vote and prioritized in order of amount deposited (addresses who have deposited closer to 100 OCTO rank higher).*
