In Progress
{: .label .label-yellow }

This simple checklist is a work in progress intended to help you with doing your own research and staying safe when investing in crypto and DeFi.

## 1. Check Website

- Team
- Documentation
- Roadmap
- Design

*Red Flags: No active team, less documentation, no real long term roadmap, bad design, yield only projects / you can lock token to mint more token bullshit*

## 2. Check Transparency 

- Transparency reports 
- Usage of funds
- Etherscan link verified tx

*Red Flags: No transparency at all*

## 3. Check Smart Contract

- Check `etherscan.io/address/CONTRACTADDRESS#writeContract` for possible mint, burn, freeze functions that can be malicious used by the deployer, 
- If you don't know how the function is used, ask the devs in telegram or check 3rd party audits

*Red Flags: mint unlimited tokens, burn user funds, freeze/ block accounts, no 3rd party audits*

## 4. Check Community & Marketing 

- Check activity on Twitter, Telegram or any other social media channels

*Red Flags: No real engagement, fake users, no activity on social media, less marketing and influencer involved / big names*

## 5. Check Etherscan 

- Actually listed on etherscan as tracked
- Check possible scam alert
- Compare contract address from etherscan with Uniswap listing
- Check transactions 
- Check holders

*Red Flags: no information on etherscan, less transactions and holders*

## 6. Check Github 

- Check development activity
- Source code just forked or own development
- Followers and forks of the source code 
- Frontend hosted on github pages

*Red Flags: No development progress, no real innovation or public source code*

## 7. Check Token Sale Stats 

- Check distribution of funds
- Distribution of tokens
- Transparency of distribution

*Red Flags: No transparency for the distribution of funds and tokens, less than 50% of total supply of token are going to the community* 

## 8. Check Rug Proof 

- Any 3rd party token locks like team.finance, unicrypt.network or trustswap
 
*Red Flags: No funds locked for a long period of time, liquidity LP Tokens are not locked*

## 9. Check Trading Activity

- Uniswap / Sushiswap analytics 
- Trading activity
- Liquidity adds / remove

*Red Flags: lots of small sized trades, few trades in a week, small liquidity pool / under $10k*

## 10. Placeholder for your own checks..
