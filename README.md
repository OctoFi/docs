## Development

To set up your environment to develop this site, run `bundle install`.

Your site is set up just like a normal Jekyll site! To test the site, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test the site's contents. As you make modifications to the theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
